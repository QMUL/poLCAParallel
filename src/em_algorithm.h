 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     Call optional methods such as set_best_initial_prob(), set_seed()

 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *      Call Fit() to fit using the EM algorithm, results are stored in the
 *      provided arrays. The EM algorithm restarts with random initial values
 *      should it fail for some reason (more commonly in the regression model)
